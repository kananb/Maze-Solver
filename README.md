# PNG-Maze-Solver
A maze solving algorithm written in Java to solve mazes saved with the .png/jpg format


### Making a maze compatible with the solver

To create a maze for this application you can use your favorite photo editing program (like MS Paint). Mark the beginning of the maze with blue and the end of the maze with red. The walls should be black and all other colors are disregarded.

The program will create a path in of purple pixels showing the shortest path from the start to the end.
